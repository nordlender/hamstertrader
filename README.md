# Assignment 2
## Group 2

- Christopher A. V. Johansen
- Erik S. Ingebrigtsen

## Choice of algorithm
In this assignment we've chosen to use **linear regression**.
This is because:
1. Classification cannot predict a stock price like the assignment asks for, it can only predict stock price *movement*.
2. It gives a quantifiable result.
3. It is better for long-term predictions.

## Reasons not to chose this algorithm
1. TSLA is a volatile stock.
2. Long-term investments for volatile stocks are stupid investments.
3. It is inaccurate, same-day investing and predictions are more applicable.
