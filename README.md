# Assignment 2
This is an assignment for our Intro to AI class.

## Group 2
- Ahmetcan Kuyu
- Ali Sarikhaya
- Christopher A. V. Johansen
- Erik S. Ingebrigtsen

## Choice of algorithm
In this assignment we've chosen to use **linear regression**.
This is because:
1. Classification cannot predict a stock price like the assignment asks for, it can only predict stock price *movement*.
2. It gives a quantifiable result.
3. It is better for long-term predictions.

## Reasons not to chose this algorithm
1. TSLA is a volatile stock.
2. Long-term investments for volatile stocks are stupid investments.
3. It is inaccurate, same-day investing and predictions are more applicable.

## Note
We've not implemented a "percentage score" as the assignment asks for.
This doesn't really seem to make sense for linear regression. See associated MSE scores in the notebook.

We've also made several models to show that we have the skills to implement new features, even though the features aren't that good.
See comments and reasoning in notebook file.

## For the aspiring stock trader
Don't use this. Hamster trader is better.
